# CS50P W6 - File I/O
`File I/O` refers to the process of reading data from and writing data to files.

1. 
```py
names = []

for _ in range(3):
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    names.append(name)
```
<br>

2. 
```py
names = []

for _ in range(3):
    names.append(input("What's your name? "))
```
<br>

3. 
```py
names = []

for _ in range(3):
    names.append(input("What's your name? "))
for name in sorted(names):
    print(f"hello, {name} ")
```
> The **sorted()** function sorts the list in alphabetical order. Notice that once this program is executed, all information is lost. File I/O allows our program to store this information such that it can be used later.

<br>

## `open`
`open` is a functionality built into Python that allows you to open a file and utilize it in your program.

<br>

1. `"w"`
```py
name = input("What's your name? ")

file = open("names.txt", "w")
file.write(name)
file.close()
```
> The **open()** function opens a file called **names.txt** with writing enabled **"w"**. The opened file is assigned to a variable called **file**.The line **file.write(name)** writes the name to the text file and the file is **close()**. 

> Note that if you run the program multiple times using different names, it will completely rewrite the **names.txt** from scratch.

<br>

2. `"a"`
```py
name = input("What's your name? ")

file = open("names.txt", "a")
file.write(name)
file.close()
```
> Changing **"w"** (writing) to **"a"** (**appending**) will allow us to continuously add names to the file. But there’s a problem, the names **will be appended without any gaps** between them (LazerAkivaEden).

<br>

3. `\n`
```py
name = input("What's your name? ")

file = open("names.txt", "a")
file.write(f"{name}\n")
file.close()
```
> Adding a new line `\n` after each of the names will solve this issue.

<br>

## `with`
It is quite easy to forget to close the file. Using a `with` block allows us to automate the closing of a file.

<br>

1. `"a"`
```py
name = input("What's your name? ")

with open("names.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(f"{name}\n")
```
> Notice that the line below the **with** block is indented.

<br>

2. `"r"`
```py
with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

for line in lines : 
    print("hello ", line)
```
> Notice that **readlines()** has the ability to read all the lines of a file and **store them in a file** called lines. Also, notice that **readlines()** automatically adds a **line break**. This, added to **print()** line break ends up with double line breaks
```
hello, Lazer
	
hello, Akiva
```
<br>

3. `rstrip()`
```py
with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

for line in lines : 
    print("hello ", line.rstrip())
```
> Adding **rstrip()** to the print() function has the effect of removing the extra **line break** at the end of each line.
```
hello, Lazer
hello, Akiva
```
<br>

4. Simplified
```py
with open("names.txt", "r") as file: 
    for line in file : 
        print("hello ", line.rstrip())
```
> This version uses `for line in file:` which removes the need to **readlines()** and iterate through all of them before printing the result.

<br>

5. `sorted()`
```py
names = []

with open("names.txt") as file: 
    for line in file : 
        names.append(line.rstrip())
    
    for name in sorted(names) : 
        print(f"hello, {name}")
```
> Notice that we initialize an empty list called **names** in memory, which will hold the names we **append()**. Then each name is **sorted()** before it is printed. To sort the list in reverse order we pass in a second argument to `sorted(names, reverse=True)`

<br>

6. Sorting the file
```py
with open("names.txt") as file: 
    for line in sorted(file) : 
        print(f"hello, ", line.rstrip())
```
> In this simplified version we **sorted()** the file directly. Notice also we did not have to specify **"w"** since it is the default mode to open a file.

<br>

## CSV
`csv` "comma separated values" are plain text files that store tabular data in a simple format where each line corresponds to a row and columns are separated by commas.

<br>

1. `split()`
```py
with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        row = line.rstrip().split(",")
        print(f"{row[0]} is in {row[1]}")
```
> **rstrip()** removes the end of each line in our CSV file. **split()** tells the compiler where to find the end of our values in our CSV file. **row[0]** is the first element of each line, **row[1]** the second. 

<br>

2. 
```py
with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
        print(f"{name} is in {house}")
```
> Instead of assigning our operation to the variable **row**, we can assign two variables `name, house`.

<br>

3. `sorted()`
```py
students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
        students.append(f"{name} is in {house}")

    for student in sorted(students):
        print(student)
```
> Here we create a list called students and **append()** each string to this list. Then we output a **sorted()** version of the list.

<br>

4. Dictionary
```py
students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
        student = {}
		student["name"] = name
        student["house"] = house  
        students.append(student)

    for student in students:
        print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")
```
> In this version we initialize a dictionary `student{}` and we add the values for each student as a **key-value** pair. Then we **append()** each dictionary to the students list. Notice that in the f-string we are using a combination of single and double quotes to differentiate.

<br>

5. 
```py
students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
        student = {"name": name, "house": house}
        students.append(student)

    for student in students:
        print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")
```
> Notice the simplified `student = {"name": name, "house": house}`.

<br>

6. `key=`
```py
students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
        student = {"name": name, "house": house}
        students.append(student)


def get_name(student):
    return student['name']

    for student in sorted(students, key=get_name):
        print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")
```
> Notice that **sorted()** needs to know how to get the **key** of each student. We define the **get_name()** function which simply returns `student["name"]` and add it as a parameter `key=get_name` to the sorted() function.

> We could also reverse the order `for student in sorted(students, key=get_name, reverse=True):`

<br>

7. `lambda()`
```py
students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
    name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")
    students.append({"name": name, "house": house})

    for student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["name"]):
        print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")
```
> A `lambda` function is an anonymous, inline function defined using the lambda keyword. In this code it is used as a **key** to the **sorted()** function. It takes the `student` dictionary as an argument and **returns** the value associated with the `name` key. This value is then used to sort the dictionaries in the list.

<br>

### `csv` module

8. `reader`
```py
import csv


students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for name, home in reader:
        students.append({"name": name, "home": home})

    for student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["name"]):
        print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")
```
> **reader()** function from the **csv** module automatically manages the reading and separating of values.

<br>

9. `DictReader`
```py
import csv


students = []

with open("students.csv") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        students.append({"name": name, "home": home})

    for student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["name"]):
        print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")
```
First we need to update the csv file to contain headers:
```
name,home
Harry,"Number Four Privet Drive"
Ron,The Burrow
Draco, Malfoy Manor 
```
> In this code we replaced **reader** by `DictReader`, which returns one dictionary at a time. This makes the code more robust as long as the CSV file has the correct **header** information.

<br>

10. `writer`
```py
import csv


name = input("what's your name? ")
home = input("where's your home? ") 

with open("students.csv", "a") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([name, home])
```
> The **csv.writer()** function takes the file as an argument. **writerow()** takes the line that we want to write to the file as a list **[name, home]**.

> At first, the original csv file only contain the headers **name,home** inputting a name and home the csv file will now show: 
```
name,home
Harry,"Number Four Privet Drive"
```
<br>

11. `DictWriter`
```py
import csv


name = input("what's your name? ")
home = input("where's your home? ") 

with open("students.csv", "a") as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "home"])
    writer.writerow({"name": name, "home": home})
```
> The **csv.DictWriter()** function takes two parameters: the file, and `fieldnames=["name", "home"]`, which is telling the compiler to write a row with two fields called name and home. **writerow()** now takes a dictionary as a parameter `{"name": name, "home": home}`.

<br>

## Binary Files and `PIL`
A **binary file** is simply a collection of ones and zeros. This type of file can store anything including audio and image data.

`PIL` "pillow" is a Python imaging library that adds image processing capabilities.

<br>

### `costumes.py`
```py
import sys
from PIL import Image


images = []

for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    image = Image.open(arg)
    images.append(image)

images[0].save(
    "costumes.gif", save_all=True, append_images=[images[1]], duration=200, loop=0
)
```
> In this code we import the sys module to be able to use command-line arguments. We also import the `Image` functionality from `PIL`. The **for** loop simply loops through the images provided as command-line arguments and stores them into the **list** called **image** and `[1:]` starts slicing **argv** at its second element.

In the last line of code: 
- `costumes.gif` is the name of the file to be created. 
- `save_all=True` saves all of the frames passed to the library. 
- `append_images=[image[1]]` appends the second image to the list already containing image[0].
- `duration=200` specifies the duration of each frame to 200 milliseconds. 
- `loop=0` determines that the loop will be infinite.

> This code results in an animated **GIF** (costumes.gif) that consists of two frames, each displayed for 200 milliseconds, looping forever.

<br>

### `image.py`
```py
from PIL import Image


def main():
    with open("in.jpeg") as img:
        print(img.size)
        print(img.format)

main()
```
<br>

1. `rotate()`
```py
from PIL import Image


def main():
    with open("in.jpeg") as img:
        img = img.rotate(180)
        img.save("out.jpeg")

main()
```
<br>

2. `filter()`
```py
from PIL import Image


def main():
    with open("in.jpeg") as img:
        img.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
        img.save("out.jpeg")

main()
```
<br>


3. `filter()`
```py
from PIL import Image


def main():
    with open("in.jpeg") as img:
        img.filter(ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES)
        img.save(”out.jpeg”)

main()
```
<br>

### `views.py`
<br>

1. `DictReader`, `PIL`
```py
import csv
 

def main():
    with open("views.csv", "r") as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
        print(row)
	
main()
```
> This code will print the entire row in **dict** format using **headers**. Specifying the key, like in `row["id"]` would print all data under `id` column.

<br>

2. `NumPy`, `PIL`
```py			
import csv
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image


def main():
    with open("views.csv", "r") as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            brightness = calculate_brightness(f"{row['id']}.jpeg") 
            print(round(brightness)) 


def calculate_brightness(filename):
     with Image.open(filename) as image:
        brightness = np.mean(np.array(img.convert("L"))) / 255
    return brightness

main()
```
> **main()** calls the **calculate_brightness()** function of every image associated with each **"id"** key in the **csv** file and prints out a resulting rounded value for each image. 

> **calculate_birghtness()** takes **row['id']** as an argument, `Image.open` the image file associated with the **'id'** and calculates its brightness:
- `img.convert("L")` method is used to convert the image to grayscale, where “L” stands for luminance.
- `np.array()` is used to convert the grayscale image into a NumPy array. Each element of this array represents the brightness of a pixel (0 black to 255 white).
- `np.mean()` calculates the average value of the elements in the NumPy array, which corresponds to the average brightness of the image.
- Finally, the average brightness is divided by **255** to normalize the value to a range between **0** and **1**.

<br>

3. Working with two files
```py
import csv
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
 
def main():
    # Open two csv files, one in reading mode and one for writing the results
    with open("views.csv", "r") as views, open("analysis.csv", "w") as analysis:
        reader = csv.DictReader(views)
        # Create a new object containing the operation writing operation on `analysis`
        # Specify analysis.csv should have the same fieldnames (headers) than views.csv
        # And one more header “brightness”
        writer  = csv.DictWriter(
            analysis, fieldnames=reader.fieldnames + ["brightness"]
            )
        # Write the headers to analysis.csv 
        writer.writeheader()

        for row in reader:
            brightness = calculate_brightness(f"{row['id']}.jpeg")
            # Write the rest of the rows (as dict) to analysis.csv
            # Assign data from reader to analysis.csv keys + brightness 
            writer.writerow(
                {
	                "id": row["id"]
                    "english_title": row["english_title"]
                    "japanese_title": row["japanese_title"]
                    "brightness": round(brightness, 2)
                }
            )


def calculate_brightness(filename):
    with Image.open(filename) as image:
        brightness = np.mean(np.array(img.convert("L"))) / 255
    return brightness


if __name__ == "__main__"
    main()
```
<br>

4. Optimize the `for` loop  	
```py
# Instead of writing a new dictionary, we can simply add "brightness" key
# To `row` dictionary before writing it and shortcut the process 
for row in reader:
    row["brightness"] = round(calculate_brightness(f"{row['id']}.jpeg"), 2)
    writer.writerow(row)
```
